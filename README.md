Simple DE0 LED Example
=======================
This is just a very small design to test the Terasic DE0 SOC board. 
The intention was to have a project 
to test the toolchain and the whole 
setup (synthese tools, usb-driver, cable connection).


Build
========
Just run syn.sh to do the whole Synthesis + Compilation.
